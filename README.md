# botfish
A Discord bot in Python

# Getting started
To use bot, add token in `auth.json`

To untrack your changes to `auth.json` to not accidentally leak the auth token when committing to this repo, run this command:
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged auth.json
```
To undo this command to make changes to `auth.json` run the following:
```
git update-index --no-assume-unchanged auth.json
```
